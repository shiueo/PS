## Problem
Timur loves codeforces. That's why he has a string s having length 10 made containing only lowercase Latin letters. Timur wants to know how many indices string s

differs from the string "codeforces".

For example string s=
"coolforsez" differs from "codeforces" in 4 indices, shown in bold.

Help Timur by finding the number of indices where string s differs from "codeforces".

Note that you can't reorder the characters in the string s.


## Input
The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases.

Each test case is one line and contains the string s, consisting of exactly 10 lowercase Latin characters.

## Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the number of indices where string s differs.

```python
import sys

n = int(sys.stdin.readline())
CODEFORCES = 'codeforces'
for i in range(n):
    c = 0
    inn = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    for k in range(len(inn)):
        if inn[k] != CODEFORCES[k]:
            c += 1
    print(c)
```
